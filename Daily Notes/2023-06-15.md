## Graph theory
Exercise:
1.1)

------------
 Much present-day interest in the
subject is due to the fact that, quite apart from being an elegant mathematical discipline
in its own right, graph theory is applied in a wide range of areas (see the Preface). We
cannot discuss a large number of these applications in a book of this size. You should
consult Berge [6], Bondy and Murty [7], Deo [13], Tucker [20] and Wilson and
Beineke [21] for a wide range of practical problems, often with algorithms or flow-
charts for their solution.
