# Why i am right and you are wrong
## A Debate on materialism

> Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms
\- Erwin Schr√∂dinger

Usualy it is important that the subject of discussion is clearly defined but since there is such a wide variety of different definitions from different people i will instead show that in general consciousness does not have to exist. 

So lets start with why im right and you are wrong

That the mind is at least in part physical should be irrefutable since physical stimuli can change the way we think, the things we see and the way we act. 

To prove my point when taking psychedelics, physical drugs which are metabolised by the body and provably change physical processes in the brain, novel thoughts, visual sensations, and different behavior can occur. 

A different example would be that victims of brain damage can have significant changes in their personality aswell as percieve visual and auditory haluciniations 

Paranoia and schizophrenia can also lead to halucinations which seem very real to the subject

That our mind can produce dellusions that fully trick us into believing that they are true is possible. And that our mind can be effected by things outside of our mind is also possible. 

Now my argument is that it is possible for the mind to create a dellusion that tricks us into a feeling of awerness of self, of sentients, of intelligence
