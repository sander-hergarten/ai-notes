# Schedule
## Run 0
1. Environment reset
2. since step buffer is empty env encoder recieves empty episode just as action encoder
3. transformer recieves nonsencical env and action vector and generates useless weights.
4. model acts out episode until completed.

## Run 1 
1. Environment reset.
2. env and action encoders recieve previous runs data to encode and train on. 
3. encoder loss is kl-divergence between 2 encoded outputs when given different runs but in the same environment and model loss mixed in.
4. transformer returns logits weights given encoding vectors
5. better actions hopefully
