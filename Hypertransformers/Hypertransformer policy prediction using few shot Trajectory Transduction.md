---
## Transformer with alternating Minimization
- [ ] Implement architecture
- [ ] Determine convergence and performance

### Task 1:
Implement the described architecture for sequence transduction

### Task 2:
Determine if model converges and predicted states are usefull. 

### Optional 1:
**IN CASE TASK 2 FAILS**
- Pretrain Transformer
- think of better architecture
