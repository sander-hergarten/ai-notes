Graphical models are a class of multivariate statistical models that are useful for representing independence relations. They are also useful to develop parsimonious models for multivariate data.

To see why parsimonious models are useful in the multivariate setting consider the problem of estimating the joint distribution of several discrete random variables. Two binary variables $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ can be represented as a two by two table which corresponds to a multinomial with four categories. Similarly, $k$ binary variables $Y_1,...,Y_k$ corresponds to a multinomial with $N=2^k$ categories.

When $k$ is even moderately large, $N=2^k$ will be huge. It can be shown in that case that the [[Maximum Likelihood Estimator]] is a poor estimator. The reason is that the data are sparse: there are not enough data to estimate so many parameters. Graphical models often require fewer parameters and may lead to estimators with smaller risk. 

There are two main types of [[Graphs|graphical models]]: 
- Undirected 
- Directed

An undirected graph example is the [[Pairwise Markov Graphs]]

# Separoid Definition

Let $M$ be a set with elements of the form $\langle A,B|C\rangle$ where $A,B,C$ are subset of a finite set $V$ (that is, $M$ is a ternary relation on $V$). Then $M$ is a separoid if it satisfies the following properties:
1. $\langle A,B|A\rangle \in M$
2. If $\langle A,B|C\rangle\in M$, then $\langle B, A|C\rangle \in M$ 
3. If $\langle A,B|C\rangle\in M$ and $D\subseteq A$, then $\langle D,B|C\rangle\in M$
4. If $\langle A,B|C\rangle\in M$ and $D\subseteq A$, then $\langle A,B|C\cup D\rangle\in M$
5. If $\langle A, B|C\rangle\in M$ and $\langle A,D|B\cup C\rangle\in M$, then $\langle A, B\cup D|C\rangle\in M$ 
For a more general construction refer to:

for each vertex $v\in V$, we define a random variable $X_v$ on a sample space $\mathcal X_v$. Furthermore, for any $A\subseteq V$ we write the vector $X_A=(X_v)_{v\in V}$, the product space $\mathcal X_A=\prod_{v\in A}\mathcal X_v$, and $X=X_V$ and $\mathcal X=X_V$ 

A joint distribution $P$ for $X$ is Markov with respect to a separoid $M$ if :
 $$\langle A, B|C\rangle\in M\quad\Rightarrow X_A\perp\!\!\!\perp X_B|X_C\;[P]$$
Specifically, we will focus on the separoids induced  by graphs. We define the separoid of an undirected graph $\mathcal G$:
 $$\mathcal M(\mathcal G)=\{\langle A,B|C\rangle:\text{$A$ and $B$ are seperated by $C$ in $\mathcal G$}\}$$The separoid of a directed acyclic graph $\mathcal G$ is the set:
 $$\mathcal M(\mathcal G)=\{\langle A,B|C\rangle:\text{$A$ and $B$ are seperated by $C$ in $\mathcal G^m_{an(A\cup B\cup C)}$}\}$$
We say a distribution is markov with respect to a graph, if it is Markov with respect to its separoid.
 
We note that properties 1-5 are constructive, that is, each specifies the existence of an element of the separoid. Therefore, by iteratively applying these properties to an arbitrary set $N$ of such triples, we can generate all the elements of the smallest separoid containing  $N$, which we call the separoid closure of $N$, and denote $\overline N$. Furthermore, we say $N$ is a spanning subset of $\overline N$.

The linke between the conditional independence properties [[Conditional Independence#^a143b6|described here]] and the separoid properties above implies the following:

> [!quote] Lemma
> Let $N$ be a spanning subset of the separoid $M$, and $P$ be a distribtution for $X$ such that:
> $$\langle A,B|C\rangle \in N\quad\Rightarrow\quad X_A\perp\!\!\!\perp X_B|X_C\;[P]$$
> then $P$ is Markov with respect to $M$

The separoid of an undirected decomposable graph can be generated by the decompositions of the graph

let $\mathcal G$ be an undirected decomposable graph. Then the set:
$$\{\langle A,B|A\cap B\rangle:\text{$(A,B)$ is a decomposition of $\mathcal G$}\}$$
is a separoid spanning set for $\mathcal M(\mathcal G)$

also for directed acyclic graphs:

Let $\mathcal G$ be a directed acyclic graph, with a well-ordering $\prec$ of the vertices. Then the sets:

are separoid spanning sets for $\mathcal M(\mathcal G)$. These set s are know as the local and ordered markov properties.

$\text{nd}(v)$ are the [[Directed Graphs#Ancestors and Descendants|non-descendents]] of v


We note that for any separoid $M$, there is a natural projection onto a subset $\mathcal U \subseteq V$: 
$$M$$
