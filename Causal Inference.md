Roughly speaking, the statement "$X$ causes $Y$" means that changing the value of $X$ will change the distribution of $Y$. When $X$ causes $Y$, $X$ and $Y$ will be associated but the reverse is not in general, true. Association does not necessarily imply causation.


Two frameworks for discussing causation are:
- [[Counterfactual Model|The Counterfactual model]]
- The DAG model
