If $X$ is a discrete random variable then its range $R_X$ id a countable set, so, we can list the elements in $R_X$. In other words  we can write:$$R_X=\{x_1, x_2, x_3, ...\}$$
Where:$$X\in R_X$$

For a discrete random variable $X$, we are interested in knowing the probabilities of $X=x_k$. The event $A=\{X=x_k\}$ is defined as the set of outcomes $s$ in the sample space $S$ for which the corresponding value of $X$ is equal to $x_k$:$$A=\{s\in S|X(s)=x_k\}$$
The probabilities of events are formally shown by the probability mass function of $X$
> [!Abstract] Definition
> Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with range $R_X=\{x_1,x_2,x_3,...\}$ (finite or countably infinite). The function 
> $$P_X(x_k)=P(X=x_k),\ \textbf{for } k = 1,2,3,...$$
> is called the probability mass function (PMF) of X.

Thus the PMF is a probability measure that gibes us probabilities of the possible values for a random variable. While the above notation is the standard notation for the PMF of $X$, it might look confusing at first. The subscript $X$ here indicates that this is the PMF of the random variable $X$. Thus, for example, $P_X(1)$ shows the probability that $X=1$.
