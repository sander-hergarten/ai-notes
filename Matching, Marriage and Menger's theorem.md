## Hall's marriage theorem
The marriage theorem answers the following question, known as the mariiage problem:

> if there is a finite set of girls, each of whom knows several boys, under what conditions can all the girls marry the boys in such a way that each girl marries a boy she knows?

This problem can be represented graphically by taking $G$ to be the bipartite graph in which the vertex set is divided into two disjoint sets $V_1$ and $V_2$, corresponding to the girls and boys, and where each edge joins a girl to a boy she knows.

A complete matching from $V_1$ to $V_2$ in a bipartite graph $G(V_1, V_2)$ is a
