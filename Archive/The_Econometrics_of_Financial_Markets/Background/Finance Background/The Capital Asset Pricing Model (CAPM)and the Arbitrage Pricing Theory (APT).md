Both CAPM and APT have their strengths and weaknesses and are used in different scenarios. CAPM is a more straightforward model that is easy to use but based on more restrictive assumptions. APT, on the other hand, is more flexible and can incorporate multiple factors, but it can be more difficult to specify and test due to the need to identify relevant factors and estimate their risk premiums.



The CAPM is a model used to determine a theoretically appropriate required rate of return of an asset, given that asset's non-diversifiable risk. It shows the relationship between the expected return and the systematic risk of a security or a portfolio.

The CAPM assumes that investors require a return that exceeds the risk-free rate for assuming extra risk, and that this premium will increase linearly with systematic risk (as measured by beta).

The APT, on the other hand, is a more complex model that seeks to explain asset returns through a linear relationship with multiple factors. Unlike the CAPM, which considers only systematic risk, the APT allows for multiple sources of systematic risk.

In the APT, the factors could include things like the growth rate of the economy, inflation rates, interest rates, market returns, etc.

One of the key ideas of APT is that if asset prices deviate from what the model predicts, arbitrage opportunities will exist. Arbitrageurs can take advantage of price differences in different markets for the same asset and make risk-free profits, and their actions will push prices back in line with the model's predictions.
