In naive set theory we assume the existence of some given domain of 'objects', out of which we may build sets. Just what these object are is of no interest to us. Our only concern is the behaviour of the 'set' concept. This is, id course, a very common situation mathematics. For example, in algebra, wehen we discuss a group, we are (usually) not interested in what the elements of the group are, but rather in the way the group operation acts upon those elements. When we come to develop our set theory axitomatically we shall in fact remove this assumption of an initial domain, since everything will then be a set. In set theory there is really only one fundamental notion: The ability to regard any collection of objects as a single entity.
