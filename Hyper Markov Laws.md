 [[Markov Properties]]
Hyper Markov Properties  enable the parameterisation and estimation of graphical models. These state that the parameters should exhibit [[Conditional Independence]], similar to those on the sample space. When these properties are satisfied, parameter estimation may be performed locally that is the estimators for certain subsets of the graph are determined entirely by the data corresponding to the subset.
