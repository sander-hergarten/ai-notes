Mathematics Background:

e multiple integration  
0 multivariate constrained optimization 
0 matrix algebra  
0 basic rules of matrix differentiation.

- Note: 
option- and other derivative-pricing models, and continuous- time asset pricing models, require some passing familiarity with the It6 or stochastic calculus. A lucid and thorough treatment is provided by Merton (1990), who pioneered the application of stochastic calculus to financial economics. More mathematically inclined readers may also wish to consult Chung and Williams (1990).


Probability and Statistics Background
0 definition of a random variable 
0 independence
0 [[Distributions]] and density functions
0 conditional probability  
0 modes of convergence  
0 laws of large numbers
0 central limit theorems.
 
Statistics is, of course, the primary engine which drives the inferences that financial econometricians draw from the data. As with probability the- ory, statistics can be taught at various levels of mathematical sophistication. 

Moreover, unlike the narrower (and some would say "purer") focus of proba- bility theory, statistics has increased its breadth as it has matured, giving birth to many well-defined subdisciplines such as multivariate analysis, nonpara- metrics, time-series analysis, order statistics, analysis of variance, decision theory, Bayesian statistics, etc. 

Each of these subdisciplines has been drawn upon by financial econometricians at one time or another, making it rather difficult to provide a single reference for all of these topics. 

Amazingly, such a reference does exist: Stuart and Ord's (1987) three-volume tour de force. A more compact reference that contains most of the relevant material for our purposes is the elegant monograph by Silvey (1975). For topics in time-series analysis, Hamilton (1994) is an excellent comprehensive text. Key concepts include

0 Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing 
0 linear regression  
0 maximum likelihood
0 basic time-series analysis (stationarity, autoregressive and ARMA pro-
cesses, vector autoregressions, unit roots, etc.) 
0 elementary Bayesian inference.


Finance Background 

0 [[Risk aversion and expected-utility theory]]
0 static mean-variance portfolio theory  
0 the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)and the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)  
0 dynamic asset pricing models 0 option pricing theory.
