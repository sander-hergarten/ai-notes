Each of these books provides a deep dive into the theory and application of dynamic asset pricing models.

1. **Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Model (CCAPM):** This model is an extension of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to an intertemporal setting. The model derives the price of an asset based on the assumption that investors derive utility from consumption and that they seek to maximize the expected utility of their lifetime consumption. In the CCAPM, the risk of an asset is related not only to the correlation of its returns with the market (as in the CAPM) but also to the correlation of its returns with consumption.
    
2. **Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM):** This model, proposed by Robert Merton, is another extension of the CAPM that takes into account multiple sources of risk. In the ICAPM, the expected return of an asset is determined not only by its market risk but also by its exposure to changes in the investment opportunity set. This means that assets that help investors hedge against changes in investment opportunities will command higher prices.
