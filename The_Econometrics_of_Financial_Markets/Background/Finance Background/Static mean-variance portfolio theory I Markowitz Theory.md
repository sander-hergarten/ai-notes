Assume that:
Investors are risk-averse, all else being equal. 

Given this, the theory posits that an investor should choose a portfolio in such a way that:
- no other portfolio exists with a higher expected return but the same (or lower) risk, 
- or the same expected return but lower risk.


The two key parameters are:

1. Expected return: This is the average outcome the investor would expect to see over many iterations. It is usually calculated as a weighted average of the returns of each asset in the portfolio, with the weights corresponding to the proportion of the portfolio invested in each asset.
    
2. Variance (or standard deviation as a measure of risk): This is a measure of the dispersion of possible returns. It reflects the degree of uncertainty associated with the return of the portfolio. A portfolio with a higher variance has more risk. Variance is calculated as a weighted average of the variances and covariances of the returns of the assets in the portfolio.
    

The efficient frontier is a key concept in the mean-variance portfolio theory. It is a curve in expected return-standard deviation space that includes all portfolios that maximize expected return for a given level of risk (or minimize risk for a given level of expected return). The portfolios on the efficient frontier are called "efficient" portfolios.

One important implication of the mean-variance portfolio theory is the idea of diversification. The theory shows mathematically why it can be beneficial to spread investments across different assets that are not perfectly positively correlated. Diversification can allow an investor to achieve a given level of expected return with less risk, or a higher expected return for a given level of risk.

The mean-variance portfolio theory is a static theory, meaning it assumes that the investor chooses a portfolio without regard to how its performance could affect their future investment opportunities. This is one of several simplifying assumptions the theory makes. Others include that investors can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate, that there are no transaction costs or taxes, and that all investors have the same expectations about the future returns of assets.
