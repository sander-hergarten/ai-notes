Mathematics Background:

e multiple integration  
0 multivariate constrained optimization 
0 matrix algebra  
0 basic rules of matrix differentiation.

- Note: 
option- and other derivative-pricing models, and continuous- time asset pricing models, require some passing familiarity with the It6 or stochastic calculus. A lucid and thorough treatment is provided by Merton (1990), who pioneered the application of stochastic calculus to financial economics. More mathematically inclined readers may also wish to consult Chung and Williams (1990).


Probability and Statistics Background
0 definition of a random variable 
0 independence
0 [[Distributions]] and density functions
0 conditional probability  
0 modes of convergence  
0 laws of large numbers
0 central limit theorems.
