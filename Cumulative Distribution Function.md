The CDF of a random variable is another method to describe the distribution of random variables. The advantage of the CDF is that it can be defined for any kind of random variable (discrete, continuous, mixed).

> [!Abstract] Definition
> The CDF of random Variable $X$ is defined as:$$F_X(x)=P(X\le x), \textbf{ for all } x\in \mathbb{R}$$

In general, let $X$ be a discrete random variable with range $R_X = \{x_1,x_2,x_3,...\}$ so that $x_1<x_2<x_3<...$ Here we assume that the range $R_X$ is bounded from below, i.e.,$x_1$ is the smallest value in $R_X$. if this is not the case then $F_X(x)$ aproaches zero as $x\rightarrow -\inf$ rather than hitting zero.
