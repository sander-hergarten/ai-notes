# Definition
Consider a [[Set]] $X$.
A $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal F$ of subsets of $X$ is a collection $\mathcal F$ of subsets of $X$ satisfying the following conditions:
1. $\emptyset \in \mathcal F$ 
2. if $B \in \mathcal F$ then its [[Sample Spaces and Events#^5f5e8a|complement]] $B^c$ is also in $\mathcal F$
3. if $B_1, B_2, ...$ is a countable collection of  sets in $\mathcal F$ then their union is $\bigcup\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n$ 
An [[Set|Atom]] of $\mathcal F$ is a set $A\in \mathcal F$ such that the only subsets of $A$ which are also in $\mathcal F$ are the empty set and $A$ itself. 

Any sigma-algebra $\mathcal F$ of subsets of X lies between these two extremes:
$$\{\emptyset,X\}\subset\mathcal F\subset \mathcal P(X)$$
A partition of $X$ is a collection of disjoint subsets of $X$ whose union is all of X. For simplicity, consider a partition consisting of a finite number of sets $A_1,...,A_N$. Thus
$$A_i\cap A_j=\emptyset\quad \text{and}\quad A_1\cap...\cap A_N =X $$
Then the collect $\mathcal F$ consisting of all unions of the sets $A_j$ forms a $\sigma$-algebra. 

# Generated Sigma-Algebra $\sigma(\mathcal B)$ 
Let $X$ be a set and $\mathcal B$ a non-empty collection of subsets of $X$. The smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing all the sets of $\mathcal B$ is denoted 
$$\sigma(\mathcal B)$$
and is called the sigma-algebra generated by the collection $\mathcal B$. The term "smallest" here means that any sigma-algebra containing the sets of $\mathcal B$ would have to contain all the sets of $\sigma(\mathcal B)$ as well. We need to check that such a smalled sigma-algebra exists. TO this end observe first the following fact:
