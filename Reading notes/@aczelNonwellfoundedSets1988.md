## Introduction
A non-well-founded set is an extraordinary set in the sense of Mirimanoff. Such as set has an infinite descending membership sequence; i.e. an infinite sequence of sets, consisting of an element of the set, an element of that element, an element of that element of that element and so on.

What is extraordinary about such a set is that it would seem that it could never get formed. for in order to form the set we would first have to form its elements, and to form those elements we would have to have previously formed their elements and so on leading to an infinite regress. Of course this anthropomorphic manner of speaking about the formation of sets is only that; a manner of speaking. We humans do not actually physically form sets out of their elements, as sets are abstract objects. 

Nevertheless the sets that have been needed to represent the standard abstract objects of modern mathematics have in fact been the ordinary well-founded ones. This observation has been institutionalised in the standard axiom system *ZFC* of axiomatic set theory, which includes among its axioms the foundation axiom ***FA***. This axiom simply expresses that all sets are well-founded.

If non-well-founded  sets are not needed for the development of mathematics then it may well seem natural to leave them out of consideration when formulating an axiomatic basis for mathematics. 

Sometimes a stronger view is expressed. According to that view there is only one sensible coherent notion of set. That is the iterative conception in which sets are arranged in levels, with the elements of a set placed at lower levels than the set itself. For the iterative conception only well-founded sets exist and FA and the other axioms of ZFC are true when interpreted in the iterative universe of pure sets. 

There has been yet one more reason why FA has been routinely included among the axioms of axiomatic set theory. This is the fact that the cumulative hierarchy of the iterative universe has an enticingly elegant mathematical structure.

This structure was already revealed by Mirimanoff and over the years it has been powerfully exploited by set theorists in a great variety of model constructions. There is a natural reluctance to forgo the pleasure of working within this structure. 

It turns out that other approaches can be treated in a uniform manner and this leads to the formulation of an axiom AFA$^\sim$ relative to the definition of a suitable relation $\sim$ to express the criterion of set equality. The suitable relations $\sim$ are called regular bisimulation relations and range between two possible extremes:
1. The maximal bisimulation relation on the univere of sets. This relation gives the most generous criterion for set equality which roughly states that sets are equal whenever possible keeping in mind that if two sets are equal then any element of one set must be equal to an element of the other set. It is this relation that gives rise to the axiom AFA. 
2. The other extreme of a strengthening is of the extensionality criterion for set equality which roughly states that two sets are equal if they are isomorphic in a suitable sense. This gives rise to yet another anti foundation axiom that we call FAFA. It turns out that there is an alternative notion of isomorphism between sets which gives rise to yet another anti foundation axiom which we call SAFA

In all we consider the four specific anti-foundation axioms AFA, BAFA, FAFA and SAFA. Each can be consistently added to the axiom system ZFC$^-$ and each gives rise to an axiom system in which every possible non-well-founded set exists when account is taken of the particular criterion of set equality.that is being used.
