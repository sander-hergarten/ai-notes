1. How do we test if two random variables are independent
2. How do we estimate the strength of dependence between two random variables

When $Y$ and $Z$ are not independent we say that they are dependent or associated or related. If $Y$ and $Z$ are associated, it does not imply that $Y$ causes $Z$ or that $Z$ causes $Y$. If $Y$ does cause $Z$ then changing $Y$ will change the distribution of $Z$, otherwise it will not change the distribution of $Z$.

For example, quitting smoking $Y$ will reduce your probability of heart disease $Z$. In this case $Y$ does cause $Z$. As another example, owning a TV $Y$ is associated with having a lower incidence of starvation $Z$ But giving a starving person a TV will not cause to stop being hungry
