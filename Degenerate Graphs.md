A $k$-degenerate [[Graphs|graph]] is an undirected graph in which every [[Graphs#Subgraphs|subgraph]] has a vertex of degree at most $k$: that is, some vertex in the subgraph touches $k$ or fewer of the subgraphs edges. 

## Degeneracy
The degeneracy of a graph is the smallest value of $k$ for which it is $k$-degenerate. The degeneracy of a graph is a measure of how sparse it is, and is within a constant factor of other sparsity measures such as the arboricity
