# Definition
The score is the gradient of the [[Likelihood|log-likelihood]] with respect to an $m$-dimensional parameter vector $\theta$
$$s(\theta)\equiv\frac{\partial\log\mathcal L(\theta)}{\partial \theta}$$This differentiation yields a $(1\times m)$ row vector, and indicates the sensitivity of the likelihood
