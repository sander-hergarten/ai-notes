We assume that we have a plentiful supply of atoms so that for each [[Pure Sets|pure set]] $i$ there is an [[Atoms|atom]] $x_i$, with $x_i \ne x_j$ for distinct pure sets $i,j$. 

## $X$-Sets
If $X$ is a class of atoms then we call sets that may involve atoms from the class $X$ in their build up $X$-Sets.
