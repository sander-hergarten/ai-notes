A mixture distribution is a mixture of two or more probability distributions. Random variables are drawn from more than one parent population to create a new distribution. The parent populations can be univariate or multivariate. although the mixed distributions should have the same dimensionality. in addition, they should either be all discrete probability distributions or all continuous probability distributions.

# Formal definition
A random variable has a $p_1$ chance of following a $D_1$ distribution, a $p_2$ chance of following a $D_2$ distribution and a $p_n$ chance of following a $D_n$ distribution, where "n" is the number of possible distribution . A mixture distribution can also be defined by the following formula:
$$f(x) = \sum^k_{k=1}\lambda_kf_k(x)$$
where $f_n$ are the component [[Probability Density Function]] and $\lambda_n$  are the mixing weights
