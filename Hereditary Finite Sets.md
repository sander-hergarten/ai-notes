$$\Omega=\set{\Omega}$$

while unfolding a [[Non-Well-Founded Sets|non-well-founded set]] such as the above it seem to suggest that $\Omega$ is an infinite object even though it is as finite as it is unfolded. We call sets that have finite pictures Hereditarily finite
$$\Omega=\set{\set{\set{...}}}$$
another interesting property of $\Omega$ is that $\Omega$ has the characterisation that an [[Pointed Graphs|apg]] is a [[Pictures|picture]] of $\Omega$ if and only if every node of the apg has a child.
